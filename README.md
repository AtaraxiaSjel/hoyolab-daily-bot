# Configuration File
- **COOKIE_BROWSER**: You can target specific browser to be used for login. Please beware that this program doesn't support account chooser yet, so if you have multiple account you may use a browser you rarely use that only contains 1 account information.
Currently supported browsers are: `firefox`, `chrome`, `chromium`, `opera`, and `edge`. The default is `all`.
- **DELAY_MINUTE**: Sometimes, your PC is some minutes earlier than the server time. If you're experiencing reward already claimed whenever the bot started, please add some delay.
- **ACT_ID** and **COOKIE_DOMAIN_NAME** shouldn't need changing. They are present for futureproofing.
